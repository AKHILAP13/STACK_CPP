# STACK_CPP
Implementation of Stack Using Templates
The implementation of a stack using templates in C++ involves creating a template class that can handle various data types. The class contains a private dynamic array, such as std::vector, to store stack elements, and methods for standard stack operations. These methods include push for adding an item to the stack, pop for removing and returning the top item, top for retrieving the top item without removing it, isEmpty for checking if the stack is empty, and size for getting the current number of elements in the stack. By using templates, this stack implementation becomes versatile, allowing the creation of stacks for different data types without rewriting the code for each type. The main function demonstrates the stack's functionality with integers, showcasing how elements can be pushed, retrieved, and popped from the stack, with appropriate error handling for operations on an empty stack.
